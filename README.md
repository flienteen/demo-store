# Demo Store App - [Test it online](http://demostore-flienteen.rhcloud.com/)
## A web app that fulfills these user stories:
* I want to view a list of products.
* I want to view a single product.
* I want to comment on a product.
* I want to view other comments when I view a product.
* I want to create a product with a name, description, and price (assume USD).
* Communicate with HTTP to a backend. (Note: can be mocked for this exercise - use ngMockE2E and $httpBackend)
* Structure your code sanely. Use directives, services, controllers, etc. where appropriate.
