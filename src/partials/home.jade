	h2 Welcome to the Demo Store App
	p Using Angular.js, make a web app that fulfills these user stories:
	p * I want to view a list of products.
	p * I want to view a single product.
	p * I want to comment on a product.
	p * I want to view other comments when I view a product.
	p * I want to create a product with a name, description, and price (assume USD).
	p * Communicate with HTTP to a backend. (Note: can be mocked for this exercise - use ngMockE2E and $httpBackend)
	p * Structure your code sanely. Use directives, services, controllers, etc. where appropriate.
	p 	Optional bonus points:
	p * Build the backend using node.js - if you use loopback.io or another set of CRUD generators, it should be a breeze.
	p * Persist the product/comment data to an actual database. (You could just store the data in memory for this exercise)
